# Getting started with Web3 on AWS

This repository contains a collection of resources for building your web3 startup and applications on AWS.

## Getting Started with Web3 

* **[Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) Explained](https://aws.amazon.com/blockchain/nfts-explained/)** - The resource discusses the concept of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which are unique digital assets. NFTs are being used in various industries, including art, music, and sports, to represent ownership and authenticity of digital assets. The resource explores the underlying technology behind NFTs, such as blockchain and smart contracts, and how it enables secure and transparent record-keeping of ownership and transactions.

* **[Mint and deploy NFTs using Amazon Managed Blockchain](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/mint-and-deploy-nfts-to-the-ethereum-blockchain-using-amazon-managed-blockchain/)** - The article explains how to create and deploy Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain using Amazon Managed Blockchain. It covers the basic concepts of NFTs, Ethereum, and smart contracts, and provides step-by-step instructions on how to build the application on AWS.

* **[Workshop: Web3 Development](https://catalog.workshops.aws/web3dev/)** - A hands-on step-by-step workshop that will give you the practical technical foundations to start your Web3 development journey. Through the use of different tools and programming languages such as Remix, Solidity, Python, Node and React, you will learn to create and deploy contracts to the Ethereum blockchain, and interact with contracts through Decentralised Applications (dApps).
 
* **[Expert Office Hours: AWS Startup Loft](https://aws-startup-lofts.com/meet-aws-expert)** - The AWS Startup Lofts program provides Web3 founders with access to Web3 and AWS experts who can offer guidance. AWS Startup Loft also offers events, networking opportunities and resources to help founders connect with other entrepreneurs and experts in the Web3 community.

* **[Video: Build, launch, and scale your Web3 startup on AWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwuTkN15Uc)** - The video talks through the differences between web2 and web3 applications, 3 common web3 architectures including read-only, user-pays and service-pays architectures, as well as security and scalability in web3.

## Building Web3 Applications

* **[Develop a Full Stack Serverless NFT Application with Amazon Managed Blockchain](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/part-1-develop-a-full-stack-serverless-nft-application-with-amazon-managed-blockchain/)** - The article explains how to develop a full-stack, serverless Non-Fungible Token (NFT) application using Amazon Managed Blockchain. It covers the basic concepts of NFTs, blockchain, and smart contracts, and provides step-by-step instructions on how to build and deploy the application on AWS. In addition, please see [Workshop](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/fa60245b-9832-4910-8183-0616997a9ebf/en-US) for a hands-on step-by-step guide.

* **[Subsidize Ethereum blockchain transaction costs for your users](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/subsidize-ethereum-blockchain-transaction-costs-for-your-users/)** - The article describes how to subsidize the cost of Ethereum blockchain transactions for users of decentralized applications (dApps) by using Amazon Web Services (AWS). It explains the basic concepts of gas fees and how subsidizing them can help increase user adoption.

* **[Access Bitcoin and Ethereum open datasets for cross-chain analytics](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/access-bitcoin-and-ethereum-open-datasets-for-cross-chain-analytics/)** - The blog post introduces Bitcoin and Ethereum open datasets available through AWS Open Data. It explains how these datasets can be easily and accessed used to gain insights. 

* **[Workshop: Web3 Development on BNB Smart Chain (BSC)](https://catalog.workshops.aws/web3dev-bsc)** - A hands-on step-by-step workshop that will give you the practical and technical foundations to start your Web3 development journey on BNB Smart Chain. BNB Smart Chain is a blockchain network built by Binance that allows for faster and cheaper transactions than the Ethereum network.

* **[Workshop: Web3 Development on Fantom](https://catalog.workshops.aws/web3dev-fantom)** - A hands-on step-by-step workshop that will give you the practical and technical foundations to start your Web3 development journey on Fantom. You will begin with learning how to create and interact with your wallet. Then, you will learn how to use several tools and concepts to create a Web3 fantasy game.

## Web3 Security: dapp Authentication

* **[dApp authentication with Amazon Cognito and Web3 proxy with Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/dapp-authentication-with-amazon-cognito-and-web3-proxy-with-amazon-api-gateway/)**
If your decentralized application (dApp) must interact directly with AWS services like Amazon S3 or Amazon API Gateway, you must authorize your users by granting them temporary AWS credentials. This solution uses Amazon Cognito in combination with your usersâ€™ digital wallet to obtain valid Amazon Cognito identities and temporary AWS credentials for your users. It also demonstrates how to use Amazon API Gateway to secure and proxy API calls to third-party Web3 APIs.

## Web3 Security: Secure Wallet and Key Management

* **[Use Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to securely manage Ethereum accounts](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/part1-use-aws-kms-to-securely-manage-ethereum-accounts/)** - The post explains how to use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to securely manage Ethereum accounts, including storing, encrypting private keys, and signing transactions. 

* **[AWS Nitro Enclaves for secure blockchain key management](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/part-1-aws-nitro-enclaves-for-secure-blockchain-key-management/)** - The article introduces AWS Nitro Enclaves and explains how its isolated compute enviroment can be used for secure, scalable blockchain key management and transaction signing. It outlines how using AWS Nitro Enclave can solve some of the challenges that an AWS KMS-based approach may have. In addition, please see associated [Guidance](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/secure-blockchain-key-management-with-aws-nitro-enclaves/) and [Workshop](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/43e486ba-8d4c-40c3-a497-beb9109a9f2c/en-US) for a hands-on step-by-step guide. 

## Web3 Security: Smart Contract Security

* **[Workshop: Ethical hacking for smart contracts](https://catalog.workshops.aws/web3-ethical-hacking/)** -  A hands-on step-by-step workshop that will give you an understanding of some of the security risks and common vulnerabilities associated with Ethereum smart contracts.
